		<h3>Percentages</h3>
		<p><b>Concept of Percentage :</b> By a certain percent ,we mean that many hundredths. Thus
			x percent means x hundredths, written as x%.</br>
			To express x% as a fraction : We have , x% = x/100.
			Thus, 20% =20/100 =1/5; 48% =48/100 =12/25, etc.</br>
			To express a/b as a percent : We have, a/b =((a/b)*100)%.
			Thus, Â¼ =[(1/4)*100] = 25%; 0.6 =6/10 =3/5 =[(3/5)*100]% =60%.</p>
		<p>If the price of a commodity increases by R%, then the reduction in consumption so
			asnot to increase the expenditure is</br>
			[R/(100+R))*100]%.</br>
			If the price of the commodity decreases by R%,then the increase in consumption so as
			to decrease the expenditure is</br>
			[(R/(100-R)*100]%.</p>
		<p><b>Results on Population :</b> Let the population of the town be P now and suppose it
			increases at the rate </br>
			R% per annum, then :</br>
			1. Population after nyeras = P [1+(R/100)]^n.</br>
			2. Population n years ago = P /[1+(R/100)]^n.</p>
		<p><b>Results on Depreciation :</b> Let the present value of a machine be P. Suppose it
			depreciates at the rate</br>
			R% per annum. Then,</br>
			1. Value of the machine after n years = P[1-(R/100)]n.</br>
			2. Value of the machine n years ago = P/[1-(R/100)]n.</p>
		<p>If A is R% more than B, then B is less than A by</br>
			[(R/(100+R))*100]%.</br>
			If A is R% less than B , then B is more than A by</br>
			[(R/(100-R))*100]%.</p>
